# Introduction

This book is the documentation for programatically interacting with {{gameName}} game. Like the game this is very much a work in progress.

## To Beginners

I hope this serves as a fun way to learn how to program logic to interact with and automate various processes within the game.

While this documentation provides code examples, you may also benefit from practicing with online resources.

- <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> - is a great free resource for learning JavaScript.
- Google (or search engine of choice) + Stack Overflow - as you search for answers to code questions you are likely to end up on Stack Overflow, which will most liekly be relevant to your question or often, the answer.

## To Non-Beginners

I hope this serves as a fun way to put your programming skills to the test by automating various processes within the game using JavaScript.

As you work with the provided interfaces for interacting with the game, you may notice some things that may not be considered best practice. While I try to adhear to good practces, some choices I make are to create as simple of an interface as possible for anyone who might be interested in trying to build scripts for the game. All of this is likely to evolve as the game's implemenation starts to settle.

If there is interest in being able to interact with the game in other languages using a websocket connection, I can enhance the documentation to explain other processes not described here, such as how to login.
