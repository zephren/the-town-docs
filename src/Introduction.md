# Introduction

This book is the documentation for programatically interacting with {{gameName}} game

## To Beginners

I hope this serves as a fun way to learn how to program logic to interact with and automate various processes within the game.

While this documentation provides code examples, you may also benefit from practicing with online resources.

\[TODO: list some sources\]

## To Non-Beginners

I hope this serves as a fun way to put your programming skills to the test by automating various processes within the game using JavaScript.

As you work with the provided interfaces for interacting with the game, you may notice some things that may not be considered best practice. While I try to adhear to good practces, some choices I make are to create as simple of an interface as possible for anyone who might be interested in trying to build scripts for the game.
